## My Thoughts on JavaScript

I find it exciting but slightly daunting to step my foot into JavaScript. Initially, I’ve always thought learning new things were really scary but as I progressed into my journey of programming, I learned it can also be fun. At the start of my Software Engineering class, we performed basic exercises on freecodecamp.org to get us introduced and start typing JavaScript. So far doing these exercises, I can say that JavaScript feels much easier to take in than Java or even C++, so in that sense I think JavaScript is a really nice programming language for how straight forward it feels.  

## Valuable Lessons

In my Software Engineering class, our professor created a pedagogy called “athletic software engineering” to increase our competency in our software engineering skills. This learning approach includes high intensity, time-constrained, and stress so that we are able to adapt to those situations. In this class we are given WOD’s, Workout Of the Day, which serves as a valuable role in enhancing our understanding of JavaScript. These workout sessions actively reinforce the knowledge gained from previous class sessions and provide an opportunity for hands-on practice to solidify concepts. 

Through consistent interaction with the WOD’s and practice WOD’s, we are able to judge if we actually learned the material from the previous week, if not we will have to change our study habits. Personally, I don’t mind this way of learning because we would need time to become proficient anyways and I perform better when I take small steps at a time. Despite the stressful situation, the approach of athletic software engineering provides valuable lessons like discipline. Just like the WOD’s, discipline is a necessary skill to help maintain consistency and focus. Moving onwards, I look forward to applying the skills I’ve learned in the future.
