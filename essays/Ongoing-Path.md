## Interests 

Growing up, I never knew what I was really interested in but I always had a deep fascination for anything technology-related. Towards the end of my high school years, I knew I wanted to go to University for some sort of Engineering degree. After discussing with advisors I decided that Software Engineering was the way to go and heard Computer Science was more coding based which was on my mind for some time. 

Going into this degree, I became fascinated by how programming is implemented into most of the things we use today. It is definitely a surreal experience to think that I grew up playing video games or browsing the web and to think that this was all programmed by someone in this world with the understanding I have now about coding. 

Although I haven't discovered all the possibilities in the Computer Science field, I have an interest in Software Engineering and Web Development. I hear that these are big fields with tons of opportunities which means there are a lot more things to discover. More recently, I developed an interest in Machine learning and itâ€™s interesting how wide this field stretches out to.

## What will the future hold? 

To be completely honest, I do not know what my future holds. All I know is that there are large opportunities waiting for me in the future with this degree. Currently, I lack a ton of experience and knowledge to become a professional programmer so I hope to learn more about this field and more about myself and what my interests are. I wish to gain experience along the way so I can become successful in this field.
